      <p>In the highly competitive world of video-on-demand (VOD) platforms, even
        broadcasters in smaller markets can achieve success. Let’s look at how Switzerland’s CH Media went about developing their streaming
        platform oneplus, with Lovely Systems, an Austrian-based development firm
        playing a pivotal role as their central service provider. By prioritizing the customer
        experience and flexibility, CH Media was able to overcome challenges, maximize
        efficiency, and achieve more than satisfactory results.</p>

      <h3>Out-of-the-box to meet a launch deadline: a fake good idea or how to operate in the stone age</h3>
      <p>In the race to meet a tight launch deadline due to not one but two partnerships with

        an advertising agency and a telco operator, CH Media initially relied on out-of-the-
        box solutions, such as standard client apps and cloud services. However, they

        soon discovered the limitations of those off-the-shelf options. The need for flexibility and customisation led them to develop their own clients. While this
        decision added complexity, it proved vital in the long run for achieving their vision.
        A key learning was to not commit to a launch date when launching something big.</p>

      <h3>Distribution as one of the key success factors</h3>
      <p>Recognising the importance of effective distribution, CH Media implemented a
        targeted and prioritised strategy. Leveraging Lovely Systems, nine applications
        were developed based on three codebases. This allowed CH Media to cater to
        different platforms, including web, Android phone, iPhone/iPad, AndroidTV,
        AppleTV, Tizen, and three telecom operators with different technologies. Despite
        the diverse platforms, they ensured consistent design and user experience across
        all applications, maximizing their reach and engagement.</p>

      <h3>Taking bold decisions: changing the tech stack after 12-24 months</h3>
      <p>Embracing a culture of innovation and adaptability, CH Media made a bold
        decision to change its tech stack after 12 months of operation. They transitioned
        from standard clients and cloud solutions to a more flexible and agile solution. By
        progressively building own backend infrastructure and backend services, CH
        Media gained full control over the platform's features and enhanced the ability to
        meet evolving customer demands.</p>
      <p>While keeping commodity services like DRM and video delivery at standardised
        SaaS services, the team moved business logic and features to their own tailored
        services. This allows a much tighter coupling of clients to the backend services
        through optimized graphQL APIs, thus sharing data between the front-end (client)
        and back-end (server) components, ensuring smooth and optimized interactions
        between them.</p>

      <h3>Learnings: reusability, efficiency, and flexibility ensure maximum agility and cost optimisation</h3>
      <p>Throughout their journey, CH Media learned valuable lessons about reusability,
        efficiency, and flexibility. By using shared libraries across their three codebases,
        they achieved consistency and reduced development effort. They discovered that
        customisation and speed were crucial for success, outweighing the initial benefits
        of out-of-the-box solutions. Despite operating with a limited budget, they managed
        to optimise costs and achieve maximum agility through close collaboration with the
        developer, Lovely Systems.</p>
      <p>“Let’s be clear and honest, a lot remains to be improved on the platform but it is a
        rewarding and interesting journey that we are glad to be on,” says Paul Fournier, Head of Business
        Development and Digital at CH Media.</p>

      <h3>A look at the KPIs</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Development of 9 applications with 3 code bases, resulting in a unified look
          and feel across all platforms.</li>
        <li>Acquisition of a six-figure subscriber base within a year (in a total market
          size of a low 7-figure) through a targeted and prioritised distribution
          strategy.</li>
        <li>Management of a tech stack with a budget 2x to 4x lower than end-to-end
          providers, showcasing flexibility and agility.</li>
        <li>Successful development and rollout of a dedicated app for a telco Set-Top
          Box (STB) based on the Metrological technology within 7 months, despite the high complexity of that technology, with additional bundling and billing
          options accomplished within 4 additional months. The project was
          completed within a mid-six-figure budget, significantly more cost-effective
          compared to quotes from end-to-end platform and backend providers.</li>
        <li>Additional dedicated apps for Android TV-base STBs were smoother to
          develop and brought to market within a couple of months.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>“Operating in a smaller market with limited resources does not mean
        compromising on quality or control,” says Paul. “CH Media’s story highlights in our
        view the benefits of a tailored approach, leveraging a service provider's expertise
        with whom we collaborate closely, and prioritising customer-centricity. By
        prioritising reusability, efficiency, and flexibility, CH Media achieved agility, cost
        optimisation, and a higher-than-expected subscriber base.”</p>
