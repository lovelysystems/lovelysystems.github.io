## Development

You need to statically serve the files in this folder, e.g. with Node.js
installed you can run `npx serve .`.

To change the API URL, you need to change the configuration in index.html;
search for `API_URL`.

## Notes

- `t25.html` is the target location of our 2025 T-Shirt QR Campaign
